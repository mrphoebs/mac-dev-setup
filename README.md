# mac-dev-setup

This script allow you to install all the tools you need for setting up your dev environnement on your brand new mac.

# Launch installation
```shell
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/thomaspoignant/mac-dev-setup/master/src/mac-dev-setup.sh | bash
```

# What does it install?

It will install all this tools:
- ## Homebrew
  The Missing Package Manager for macOS, Homebrew installs the stuff you need that Apple (or your Linux system) didnâ€™t.

  After the installation you will be available to install almost everything you need for your mac. You can list installed packages with `brew list` and `brew cask list`.

  I recommend running brew doctor every now and then to make sure things are good and `brew cleanup` to remove unused files.
 
 ### Docker
    Should I present what `docker` is?

    To work with docker we will install the docker runtime and also the docker command line completion who help you to write docker command like a boss.
    - docker
    - docker command line completion

  ### Languages
  The main languages I am working with are Java and Go, but here are the main languages you always need, on projects.

  - **Java**  
    Install the last version of the `openJDK` JVM.  
    It also install `maven` and `gradle`.
  - **Go / Golang**  
    Install the last `go` version and set `GOPATH` into your shell profile file.
